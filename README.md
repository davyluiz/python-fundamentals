# 🐍 Python Fundamentals

This repository was designed as a simple and interactive **guide** to remember **fundamental concepts** of **Python** programming.

Initially I'm using this to answer some questions I have and remember essential tools provided by this powerful language.

Perhaps in the near future, this repository will be open to suggestions and changes. 🤝
